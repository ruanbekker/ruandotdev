I'm a Systems Development Engineer at [JUMO](https://jumo.world/?source=ruan.dev)

I have a passion for problem solving, building things and making businesses succeed. I'm madly curious by heart, so I am very hungry for knowledge and you will always find my trying and testing out new things to stay ahead of the game.

I primarily work with AWS, Linux, Python, Automation, Systems Development, DevOps, Containers, Solutions Architecture, Open Source, Knowledge Sharing, Metrics, Systems Adminstration and making Customers happy is a big thing for me.

I have about 12 years of experience in the IT Industry that ranges from Linux Systems Administration, DevOps, BigData and Systems Development Engineering.

You will find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ruanbekker), sharing most of my blogposts that I write about tech topics on [blog.ruanbekker.com](https://blog.ruanbekker.com/?source=ruan.dev) and [sysadmins.co.za](https://sysadmins.co.za/?source=ruan.dev) and I share most of my code on my [githhub](https://github.com/ruanbekker) repository.
