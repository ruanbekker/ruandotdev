I've been wanting to create a new page for my personal website for some time now, and stumbled upon [this awesome hugo theme](https://github.com/victoriadotdev/hugo-theme-introduction) and with the inspiration of [campoy.cat](https://github.com/campoy/campoy.cat) and adopted some of his layouts to make this personal site.
