## Curious Weekly

Introducing curious weekly, a weekly post of curated articles that I stumble upon during the week. 

I am curious by heart, and I love reading up on new stuff, what people build, how people build stuff and the awesome blog posts that people publish. I always want to share the awesome stuff with the world, so I decided that I will start a blog series called "curious-weekly", where I will post my curated list every week of the awesome stuff that I stumble upon.

## Format

This page will serve as the index page and will be linked below, but all curated lists will be posted under [#curious-weekly](https://ruan.dev/categories/curious-weekly/)
