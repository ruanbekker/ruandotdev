### Mediabox Choices

So you are perhaps thinking of getting a **Android TV Mediabox**, but so many options that's in the market.

If you are looking for something that's not so expensive, responsive, simplicity and looking for applications such as
Netflix, Youtube, DSTV Now, Showmax, etc. 

This device get's hands down my **vote to go for**!

## Home Entertainment

This is my review on the **Xiaomi MiBox S Android TV Mediabox**.

For some time I had the MyGica Android Mediabox, which works fine, but since the device is not certified by Google,
Netflix and DSTV Now is not an option, and since I have a subscription for that, it's annoying having to switch devices,
depending on what you want to watch.

So I was looking for something **simple** that is **feature rich**, and the Xiaomi MiBox S, gave me what I wanted, and I must
admit, I am pretty **impressed** with it. The 3rd day that I have it and super impressed, no issues at all.

A must buy from me!

## Screenshots

## What I really like about it

Simplicity and featureability I would say does it for me. Within the first 5 minutes, I was able to setup the
applications that I need, which in my case was:

* Netflix
* Youtube
* Showmax (South Africa: Similar to Netflix)
* DSTV Now (South Africa: Sport)
* myTuner Radio (Local Radio Stations)
* Plex (Accessing local content from my media center)
* X-plore File Manager (LAN, Dropbox, OwnCloud Integrations to transfer files)

I have everything I need in one place. The UI is really clean and responsive and also quite snappy. The GPU allows you
to play games on it, but that was not the reason I got it, so have not tried to play any games on it.

I don't have any issues so far with it and if you consider getting it, I would **definitely** say it's **worth the buy**.
